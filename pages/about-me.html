            This is a co-op based, horror stealth game set inside a school
            library. There are two players: Thief and Hacker. The hacker must
            obtain information about symbols that need to be collected and
            relate that information to the thief player. The thief then must
            find the symbol within the library and reveal the code associated
            with the symbol to the hacker. Collect all 4 codes and open the
            gates to hell.
